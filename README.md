One of our team members who had to design the api for the ML model has been admitted to hospital so we weren't able to integrate the app and ML model so we are providing the link to the kaggle notebook for the ML implementation and github link for the data collection and pre processing code:

#Doctor Side Implementation

-> All doctors will be required to sign up on using the app for the first     time.

-> The sign up can be from an Email Id and password or through Google sign up

-> They will also be required to upload their license certificate so that the patient can authenticate the doctor.

-> The doctors will be provided with a functionality to accept or reject appointments requested by the patients and they will also be shown their pending appointments along with the details of the patient who has requested it.

#Patient Side Implementation

-> All patients will be required to sign up on using the app for the first time.

-> The sign up can be from an Email Id and password or through Google sign up

-> The patient will have to upload the image of the clock drawn and app will predict whether the person has dementia or not.

-> The patient can book an appointment with the concerned doctor by providing his details and the date and time of appointment
